# Functions And Errors Metacrafters - DIGITAL IDENTITY

This program is to test out statements such as `require`, `assert`, and `revert` of the solidity programming language. The purpose of the program was to demonstrate real-life innovation such as the use of digital identity with analyzing gas fees.

## Description

-  The program is a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain written in Solidity. It returns a contract with various functions such as `createIdentity`, `deleteIdentity`, `unsafeDeleteIdentity`, `updateIdentity`, `getIdentity`, and `validateIdentity`. Some of these functions must implement `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements.

-  Basically, a digital identity smart contract represents a decentralized, secure construct on a blockchain to manage and verify identities. By using smart contracts, the project ensures that identity data remains tamper-proof and verifiable, enhancing trust and transparency in digital interactions.

## Getting Started

### Installing and Executing the program

To run this program, one can utilize the provided IDE for Solidity which is Remix. To access the website, please direct to this site [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

Once you are on the website, create a new file on the "+" icon in the left-handed sidebar. Save the file with a `.sol` extension (e.g., Digital_Identity.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

To compile, click on the `Solidity Compiler` tab in the left-handed sidebar. Make sure the Compiler option is set to `0.8.18` (or another compatible version), and then click on the `Compile Digital_Identity.sol` button.

Once the compiler does not return any errors, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the `Deploy & Run Transactions` tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select any account address that contains 100 ether. Select the `Digital_Identity` contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the `Deploy` button. 

### Sample Demonstration of the Digital Identity

Once the deployment is successful, you can proceed for a sample demonstration.

#### Function `createIdentity`

#### Function `getIdentity`

#### Function `updateIdentity`

#### Function `validateIdentity`

#### Function `deleteIdentity`

#### Function `unsafeDeleteIdentity`

## Help

If it somehow happens that the functions for `validateIdentity` or `unsafeDeleteIdentity` returns an error stating that `address does not exist` , please review the Ethereum address and make it sure it is `valid`.
